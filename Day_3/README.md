# Introduction to Dynamics

Robot dynamics is concerned with the relationship between the forces acting on a robot mechanism and the accelerations they produce. Typically, the robot mechanism is modelled as a rigid-body system, in which case robot dynamics is the application of rigid-body dynamics to robots.

## Why study Robot Dynamics !
Robot Dynamics is really important since it will give you a complete understanding not only how robots move (kinematics) but also WHY they move (dynamics).
You will learn to develop the dynamics models of basic robotic systems, as well as create intelligent controllers for them.

# Simulate Dynamics in Pybullet

**To make our simulation resembling real world, We need to add/specify various physical parameters to our virtual world.**

Pybullet have inbuilt functions, which gives us easy access to get look or change these parameters.

You can look out to these parameters by [getDynamicsInfo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit#heading=h.d6og8ua34um1)

For changing these parameters, refer [changeDynamics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10sXEhzFRSnvFcl3XxNGhnD4N2SedqwdAvK3dsihxVUA/edit)
