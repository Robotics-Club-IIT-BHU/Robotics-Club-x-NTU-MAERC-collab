### Enough of boring theory, lets dive into code now!!!
We have prepared a code file with a car loaded and all the code written and well explained using comments. It is loaded at some parallel distance with the line Y=0.The car needs to follow the line Y=0 marked with black color. 


#### Each and every line of code will be expalined in the workshop. Your task is to download the code and try to change the P,I,D values and see how the result changes in the simulation

Here is a reference video to help you with understanding the code-
* [Controlling a self driving car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y7zG48uHRo)

Here you can learn more about differntial drive if you don't know yet. Contact Organisers for hints if you still don't get it-
* [Differential Drive](https://www.societyofrobots.com/programming_differentialdrive.shtml)

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE CODE-

1. Download this folder, along with the python code and src.
2. The code is well commented 
3. Execute the python code.
4. Press Escape key after selecting the track-bar window in order to start the simulation.
5. Press Escape again to reset it and run it again.

 # Task
 
 ## Now that you have understood the code and learnt to balance the car to follow a line Y=0, we want you to try this challenge.
 
1. Try to change the line direction from Y=0 to some slant line, you may change positions in the p.debugVisualiser line.
2. Now try to change the pid values accordingly such that the bot now follows the newly formed line.
 
### That's all for PID Code. Do try the above tasks and understand the code properly.
